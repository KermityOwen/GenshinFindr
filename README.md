### What is GenshinFindr?
GenshinFindr is a discord bot I've been working on to learn backend server development specifically with NodeJS and DiscordJS.
GenshinFindr was created because I wanted a way to easily search up mine or others Genshin profiles without launching the game,
so I created a discord bot that allows you to do exactly that. With GenshinFindr, all you need is the bot on your server and the UID of the player you want to search up.

### How to use?
It's simple!
- Invite the bot to your server with this link:  
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=707937982816190495&permissions=545394261200&scope=bot
- Type in "/" in a channel the bot can reach and a menu should pop up
- Type in the rest of the command or click the command you want to use
- The rest should be self-explanatory
- Easy and Done! Enjoy showing off your meticulously crafted build to your friends! :)
